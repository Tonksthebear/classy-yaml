# Progress: Classy YAML

## What Works
- ✅ Core YAML loading and parsing functionality
- ✅ `yass` helper method for fetching utility classes
- ✅ Support for multiple YAML files with priority ordering
- ✅ ViewComponent integration with sidecar YAML files
- ✅ Base class inheritance system
- ✅ Skip base functionality
- ✅ Caching system for performance optimization
- ✅ Tag helper override functionality
- ✅ **NEW**: Optional `tailwind_merge` gem integration for intelligent CSS class merging
- ✅ **NEW**: Automatic detection of `tailwind_merge` availability
- ✅ **NEW**: Fallback to simple class joining when `tailwind_merge` is not available
- ✅ **NEW**: Comprehensive test coverage for tailwind_merge integration

## What's Left to Build
- Documentation updates for new features
- Performance optimization considerations
- Additional Rails helper integrations (if needed)

## Current Status
The gem is fully functional with all core features implemented and tested. The recent addition of `tailwind_merge` integration provides intelligent CSS class merging when the gem is available, while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully implemented optional `tailwind_merge` gem integration
- Added automatic detection and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive test coverage across Rails 7, 8 (Sprockets), and 8 (Propshaft)
- All tests passing with 0 failures across all Rails versions
