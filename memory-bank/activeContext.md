# Active Context: Classy YAML

## Current Focus
The immediate development focus is on extending the gem's functionality to correctly handle YAML arrays as values for class definitions. This involves modifying the parsing/lookup logic to accommodate arrays alongside existing string values.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of the Memory Bank documentation.
- Clarification of project goals and current status.

## Next Steps
1.  **Investigate:** Analyze the current `yass` helper and related methods in `lib/classy/yaml/` to understand how YAML values are processed.
2.  **Design:** Determine the best way to handle array values. Should they be joined into a single string? How does this interact with `base` classes?
3.  **Implement:** Modify the code to support arrays.
4.  **Test:** Write Minitest tests specifically for array handling, including edge cases and interaction with `base` and `skip_base`.
5.  **Optimize (Concurrent Task):** While implementing array support, evaluate the efficiency of the class lookup and merging process. Identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- How should arrays be processed? Joining with a space (`' '`) seems the most logical approach for CSS classes.
- Ensure the change doesn't break existing functionality (string values).
- Maintain performance - avoid significant slowdowns due to array processing.
