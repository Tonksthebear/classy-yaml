# Classy::Yaml
This was created to provide convenient utility class grouping for environments without a bundler (or any situation where you might not want to add custom css classes). YAML files are a perfect structure for these situations.

## Usage
After installing the gem, the helper method `yass` will be available from anywhere. It looks for the definitions in the YAML file `config/utility_classes.yml` (note: you must add this yourself).

The YAML structure should follow this format:

```
btn:
  blue: "text-blue-200 bg-blue-500"
  yellow: "text-yellow-200 bg-blue-500"
```

Then, you can add these classes to any element by calling `yass(btn: :blue)` or `yass(btn: :yellow)`.

You may wonder though, what about shared classes you want all nested definitions to inherit? There is a special syntax for this type of inheritance:

```
btn:
  base: "px-3 py-2"
  blue: "text-blue-200 bg-blue-500"
  yellow: "text-yellow-200 bg-blue-500"
```

Now, calling `yass(btn: :blue)` or `yass(btn: :yellow)` will ALSO pull in the classes from `btn: :base`.


### ViewComponent
There is a special helper built for ViewComponent and sidecar assets. In your `example_component.rb`, add the line `include Classy::Yaml::ComponentHelpers`. This helper will tell `yass` to check if there is a `example_component.yml` file, and first use that for definitions. If the definitions aren't found in the `example_component.yml`, then it will fallback to `config/utility_classes.yml`.

So, it may look like this

```
# config/utility_classes.yml
btn:
  base: "px-3 py-2"
  blue: "text-blue-200 bg-blue-500"
  yellow: "text-yellow-200 bg-blue-500"
  
  
# app/components/example_component/example_component.yml
btn:
  purple: "text-purple-200 bg-blue-500"
  

# app/components/example_component/example_component.html.erb

<button class="<%=sass(btn: :purple)%>">Classy Button</button>

# will add the classes "px-3 py-2 text-purple-200 bg-blue-500"
```

As you can see, this will merge definitions found in the `ExampleComponent`'s sidecar asset with the main application's definitions. Not only will it merge, but it will overwrite them as well, allowing for true customization on a per-component basis:

```
# config/utility_classes.yml
btn:
  base: "px-3 py-2"
  blue: "text-blue-200 bg-blue-500"
  yellow: "text-yellow-200 bg-blue-500"
  
  
# app/components/example_component/example_component.yml
btn:
  blue: "text-blue-50"
  

# app/components/example_component/example_component.html.erb

<button class="<%=sass(btn: :purple)%>">Classy Button</button>

# will add the classes "px-3 py-2 text-blue-50"
```

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'classy-yaml'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install classy-yaml
```

If using purging for styles, be sure to add the YAML files to the purge directories. For example, below is a tailwind.config.js:
```
purge: [
   "./config/utility_classes.yml",
   "./app/components/**/*.yml" // If using component sidecar assets
]
```
